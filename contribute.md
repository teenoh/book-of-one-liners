Have a one-liner you want to share? Contribute to this project by following the steps below:
- Ensure what you want to contribute has not already been added by checking the one-liner lists on the site/repo (`/languages/{language-name}`).
- [Fork the repo](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/book-of-one-liners) and create a branch for the one-liner you want to add.
- Use [this template]({{ "/template" | relative_url }}) to create a file in the appropriate directory for the language. If the language you want to use doesn't have a folder in the repo, [start an Issue](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/book-of-one-liners/issues) about that first.
- Add the page permalink to the appropriate list file e.g a JavaScript one-liner goes into `/languages/JavaScript.md`.
- Commit and start a Pull Request (PR). Each PR must contain only one one-liner.
- The PR would be reviewed and merged ASAP!
  
If you find any code errors or typos, you can send a PR to correct it. Also, if you want any UI changes to be effected, [start an Issue](https://github.com/nicholaskajoh/book-of-one-liners/issues).
